## About me

I would like to introduce myself and present my portfolio. My name is Juliana, and I am a meticulous, detail-oriented, and highly organized professional. I have excellent time management skills and believe in taking the necessary time to do things well and efficiently.

I began my career by studying accounting, and after working as a Human Resources leader for five years, I decided to immerse myself in the field of technology. I pursued various front-end and back-end development courses, becoming proficient in programming. Additionally, I served as a programming instructor, where I designed and adapted course content to facilitate effective learning.

Currently, I am working in the technical support department, where I test the functionality of platforms on a daily basis, ensuring their proper operation. This role has allowed me to gain hands-on experience in troubleshooting, identifying and resolving technical issues, and providing efficient solutions to users.

Furthermore, I recently completed a 6-month bootcamp as a Quality Assurance (QA) professional within a development team working on an educational project. This experience has equipped me with the skills to conduct comprehensive testing, identify bugs and defects, and collaborate closely with developers to improve the overall quality of software applications.

I am passionate about technology, and my transition from accounting to the tech industry has been driven by my desire to continuously learn and adapt in this ever-evolving field. I thrive in challenging environments that require attention to detail and problem-solving skills. My commitment to excellence and my ability to effectively manage projects make me a valuable asset to any team.

Thank you for considering my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs. Please feel free to reach out to me for any additional information or to schedule an interview.
